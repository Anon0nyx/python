        - Check IP address
           - Run ' curl ifconfig.me ' for global IP (Listener)
           - Run ' ifconfig ' OR ' ip addr show ' for local IP (Host)
        - Check connection
           - Ensure that your device has a strong internet connection
        - Program was stopped
           - OR
        - Code is bugged and needs to be fixed
